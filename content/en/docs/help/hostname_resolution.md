If you are running a local `k8s` instance, you might want to configure your
local setup so that it is able to resolve the domain of the cluster. So that
out-of-cluster running programs can access your services.

There are a couple of options available to you, all with their pros & cons. We
will list some of them in this document. Note that this is not a exhaustive
coverage of all the possibilities and feel free to contribute to the
documentation if you have other ways of doing this.

## Prerequisite

Before you start, you need to have access to a running Kubernetes cluster
environment. A [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) instance
running on your laptop will do fine.

### Start minikube with a parametrized `dns-domain` name

```console
$ minikube start --dns-domain='demo.artemiscloud.io'

😄  minikube v1.32.0 on Fedora 39
🎉  minikube 1.33.1 is available! Download it: https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v1.33.1
💡  To disable this notice, run: 'minikube config set WantUpdateNotification false'

✨  Automatically selected the kvm2 driver. Other choices: qemu2, ssh
👍  Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube
🔥  Creating kvm2 VM (CPUs=2, Memory=6000MB, Disk=20000MB) ...

🌟  Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass
🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
```

Get minikube's ip

```console
minikube ip
192.168.39.54
```

Note that every time you restart minikube you'll have to follow update the ip in
the configuration files.

## /etc/hosts

The generic way to make the url resolve to an IP address is to update the
`/etc/hosts/`. There's no wildcard in this file, this means you'll need to
specify all the urls you are interested in.

Here's an example for an ingress:
```console
$ cat /etc/hosts
192.168.39.54      ing.sslacceptor.send-receive-0.send-receive-project.demo.artemiscloud.io
```
### pros

* Works on every setup and is simple

### cons

* No wildcard, you need to list every domains and subdomains you'll need to access

## NetworkManager's DNSMasq plugin

We will use networkmanager's dnsmasq plugin
([source](https://fedoramagazine.org/using-the-networkmanagers-dnsmasq-plugin/))to
configure the ip associated with the domain `demo.artemiscloud.io`. The dnsmasq plugin
has wildcards which is better than setting manually every hosts in the
`/etc/hosts` file.

### Configure DNSMasq

The goal here is to set up enable dnsmasq and to make it resolve your cluster
domain `demo.artemiscloud.io` to the cluster's ip address. Because DNSMasq has a
wildcard, all subdomains will also resolve to the same ip address.

1. Create the following files:

```console
$ cat << EOF > /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/00-use-dnsmasq.conf
[main]
dns=dnsmasq
EOF
```

```console
$ cat << EOF > /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/00-demo.artemiscloud.io.conf
local=/demo.artemiscloud.io/
address=/.demo.artemiscloud.io/192.168.39.54
EOF
```

```console
$ cat << EOF > /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/02-add-hosts.conf
addn-hosts=/etc/hosts
EOF
```

2. restart NetworkManager:

```console
$ sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

### pros

* Has wildcard, you only need to setup the ip once

### Cons

* Works only with NetworkManager

## Minikube's `ingress-dns` plugin:

[Follow the official documentation.](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/addons/ingress-dns/)

### pros

* Has wildcard, you only need to setup the ip once
* Supported for every setup (linux, mac, windows)

### cons

* Can only resolve the ingresses URLs
